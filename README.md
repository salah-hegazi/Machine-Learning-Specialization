# Machine-Learning-Specialization
A machine Learning Specialization I took from University of Washington through Coursera.
That's my codes that I typed to pass through Assignments.

In order to preview these codes in Jupyter format you should take the link of the *.ipnb file and open it through https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
